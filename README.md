## Features
# Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values
Convert categorical variables to factors

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyze the success rate of the campaign over different days of the month
Analyze the success rate of the campaign based on the contact method used
Analyze the success rate of the campaign for different job types
# Predictive Modeling:
Build a logistic regression model to predict the success of the campaign
Evaluate the model performance using confusion matrix and ROC curve
Build a decision tree model to predict the success of the campaign
Evaluate the decision tree model performance using ROC curve
