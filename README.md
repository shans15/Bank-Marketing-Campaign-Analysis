## Description
This project aims to analyze the success rate of a marketing campaign for a bank. The dataset used contains information about customers and their response to the campaign. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationship between different variables and the success of the campaign, and building predictive models to forecast the success of the campaign for future customers.

## Features
### Data Preprocessing:
1. Handle missing values  
2. Convert categorical variables to factors 
3. Convert numerical variables to numeric
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
1. Analyze the success rate of the campaign over different days of the month
2. Analyze the success rate of the campaign based on the contact method used
3. Analyze the success rate of the campaign for different job types
### Predictive Modeling:
1. Build a logistic regression model to predict the success of the campaign
2. Evaluate the model performance using confusion matrix and ROC curve
3. Build a decision tree model to predict the success of the campaign
4. Evaluate the decision tree model performance using ROC curve
